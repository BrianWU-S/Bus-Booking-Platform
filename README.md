# Bus-Booking-Platform
A customized Bus-Booking platform. It provides economical service with real-time flexible route planning and order dispatch, which contributes to a better user experience.
## Introduction
Unlike car-hailing platforms, a bus-booking platform can dispatch several
passenger orders to one bus together, compute a specially planned route cycle based on these
requirements, and then ride the passengers to their destinations sequentially. Compared to carhailing, bus-booking can effectively utilize vehicle resources, reduce energy consumption, and save
road resources. Simultaneously, passengers could be served quickly with much lower price. In
all, combining the benefits of bus service and car-hailing, this new APP provides economical
service with real-time flexible route planning and order dispatch, which contributes to a better
user experience.
